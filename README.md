a physical registry is cumbersome. This project offers a solution to that problem. 

Functionalities:
* Get all books from a retailer given its ID
* Get all books from a publishing retailer
* Get common books between two retailers
* See in which countries you can find a book given its ID
* Get languages of the books from a specific publishing retailer
